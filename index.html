            <h2>Who is CSProfessorPam?</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Pamela Price, also known as CSProfessorPam.  Teaching is my super-power!  I have been a Computer Science Professor for over 20 years.  I love to make complex concepts easy to understand.  I like to explain not just the HOW of coding, but also make sure you understand WHY it works.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about teaching. I love helping people learn and grow, and I'm committed to providing you with the best possible learning experience. A student once told me "you teach this stuff like you remember what it was like not to know it".  I love those "ah ha" moments when it all makes sense!  Jumpstart your learning by working with me as your Learning Coach.</p>
